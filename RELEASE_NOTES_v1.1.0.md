# Release Notes - Version 1.1.0

## 🎯 Major Fixes

### ✅ Hotkey Persistence Fixed
- **Issue**: Hotkeys only worked once, then stopped responding
- **Solution**: Implemented new `GlobalHotkeyManager` using low-level keyboard hook
- **Result**: Hotkeys now work continuously without interruption

### ✅ Logging Improvements
- **Issue**: Log file not being created on Desktop as expected
- **Solution**: Updated `LogWriter` to prioritize Desktop folder
- **Result**: Log file now saves to `Desktop/Chrono-log.txt` as requested

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### New Global Hotkey System
- **Architecture**: Replaced form-based hotkeys with system-level keyboard hook
- **Reliability**: Uses `SetWindowsHookEx` for global key detection
- **Debugging**: Enhanced logging with timestamps for troubleshooting
- **Performance**: More efficient key detection without polling

### Code Cleanup
- **Removed**: Unused hotkey implementations (`HotkeyManager`, `KeyboardHookManager`, etc.)
- **Consolidated**: Single, reliable hotkey system
- **Documentation**: Updated README with current architecture

## 🚀 What's New

### Enhanced Debugging
- Timestamped debug messages for hotkey detection
- Better error handling and recovery
- Detailed logging of hotkey execution flow

### Improved User Experience
- Hotkeys work reliably from any application
- Log file appears on Desktop immediately
- Better error messages and recovery

## 📋 System Requirements

- **OS**: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- **Runtime**: .NET 8.0 (included in self-contained build)
- **Size**: ~70MB (self-contained executable)

## 🎮 Hotkeys (Unchanged)

| Hotkey | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Alt+F1` | Start new session |
| `Ctrl+Alt+F2` | Pause/Resume current session |
| `Ctrl+Alt+F3` | Stop current session |
| `Ctrl+Alt+F4` | Add note to current session |
| `Ctrl+Alt+F5` | Peek overlay indicator |

## 🔍 Testing

### Verified Working
- ✅ Hotkeys work multiple times in succession
- ✅ Log file created on Desktop
- ✅ Session logging with timestamps
- ✅ Overlay indicator functionality
- ✅ System tray integration
- ✅ Single instance enforcement

### Test Scenarios
1. **Hotkey Persistence**: Press `Ctrl+Alt+F1` multiple times - should work each time
2. **Log File**: Check Desktop for `Chrono-log.txt` file
3. **Session Flow**: Start → Pause → Resume → Stop → Add Note
4. **Overlay**: Verify red/orange indicator appears and auto-hides

## 🐛 Known Issues

- None identified in this release

## 📈 Performance

- **Startup Time**: ~2-3 seconds (cold start)
- **Memory Usage**: ~8-10MB typical
- **CPU Usage**: Minimal when idle
